Pranayama (Breathng Exercises)
Kapalabhathi (cleansing, breathing exercise)
Anuloma Viloma (alternate nostril breathing)
</h4><br>
<h4><b>Kapalabhathi (pumping exercise)<br>
THE PRACTICE</b></h4><br>
Sit in a steady, comfortable, cross-legged position with the spine
straight.<br>
Both hands in chin mudra (index finger to the thumb) on your
knees.<br>
Take a few deep breaths. Then, quickly contract the abdominal
muscles pulling the abdomen in sharply, exhaling through the nose.
The inhale is passive, while the exhale is active.<br>
Do about 20-30 pumpings to start, then gradually build up to 50-
- 100 pumpings over time.<br>

After the pumping, take a deep inhale and retain the breath.
Concentrate the mind, keep the shoulders relaxed and back straight,
visualizing one single point. Hold the breath comfortably as long as
you can, and then exhale slowly. (This is one round)
Practice at least three rounds of Kapalabhati, then follow with
Anuloma Viloma (alternate nostril breathing practice.)
note:- please practice these breathing exercises once you have been
introduced to pranayama by a qualified teacher. If you have any questions,
or doubts please consult your instructor.<br><br><br>

"Pranayama is one of the most important practices in all forms of Yoga. By practicing pranayama, the Yogi is
able to control the nervous system and thereby obtains gradual control over prana or vital energy and the
mind...Yogic teachings further show, that through pranayama manâ€™s will power, self-control, concentration
power, moral qualifications, and even his spiritual evolution can be increased [through the proper practice of
pranayama.]"<br>
