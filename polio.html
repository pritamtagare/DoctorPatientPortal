Polio is a disease that has caused paralysis in millions of children worldwide over the years.
Polio is caused by a virus that lives in the throat and intestinal tract. It is spread mainly through
contact with the feces of an infected person (for instance, by changing diapers).<br>
Some children who get polio don't feel ill at all. Others have the symptoms of a common cold,
sometimes accompanied by pain and stiffness in the neck, back and legs. But some Polio
children get severe muscle pain, and within a week can be paralyzed - in other words, loose
the use of their muscles. Usually paralysis affects a child's legs, but it can also affect other
muscles, including those that control breathing.<br>
Depending on the sites of paralysis, polio can be classifiedas spinal, bulbar, or spino-bulbar
disease. Progression to maximum paralysis is rapid (2-4 days), is usuallyassociated with fever
and muscle pain, and rarely continues after the patient's temperature
has returned to normal.<br>
Spinal paralysis is typically asymmetric and moresevere proximally than distally. Deep tendon
reflexes are absent or diminished. Bulbar paral
ysis can compromise respiration and swallowing.<br>
Paralytic polio is fatal in 2%-10% of cases. After the acute episode, many patients recover at
least some muscle function and prognosis for recovery can usually
be established within 6 months after onset of
paralytic manifestations.<br>
There is no treatment for polio, and some children die from it. The incubation period for
poliomyelitis is commonly 6 to 20 days with a range of 3 to 35 days.<br>
